## Purpose:
<br>
This documentation is an overview of the 3rd Year Project for Bachelor of Science in Software Development program. This document is provided to my supervisors of the Professional Practice in IT module and can be used as a guide in understanding the finer details of the project. I will be using ionic to do the project which I am relatively familiar with, but it is an ever-evolving platform. This document will give a summary of my project and what I plan to create under the constraints of time and ability. The project is not based for use by any working business practice.
<br><br>
## Goals and Objectives:
<br>
The goal of this project is to create a reservation system using the ionic platform. The initial design uses a three-tier architecture which includes the application in conjunction of using a server and a database to receive and store information entered. The project is a system to allow for example a dentistry office to both store and receive appointments of a one-hour length. 
<br>
*	 Update all software and create a google firebase to use in the project.
* Develop a better understanding of the ionic platform since I last used it.
*	Try initially to create a log in for dentist and or patients.
*	Organise a system timetable to book appointments and mark those booked so you cannot double book.
